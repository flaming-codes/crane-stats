## Server

This is a simple server that is used during development to test the client. It is currently not used in production, as we simply access the data via the repository's URL - it's just static data.

Nevertheless, the server could be used in the future, as it is a simple Node.js server that serves the data from the `data` folder w/ the same URL structure as the repository.
